# Turbulent-Wind-Generation-with-Wake
Turbulent wind generation with the integration of Gaussian-based wake deficit distribution.

A MATLAB-based turbulent wind field generator by PEF is used to produce the scenarios of wind inflow conditions without wake profiles, as TurbSim. The modified turbulent wind field generator with the integration of Gaussian-based wake deficit distribution is developed based on the 3D Turbulent Wind Generation, which can be found at: https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/54491-3d-turbulent-wind-generation
