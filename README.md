# Turbulent-Wind-Generation-with-Wake
Turbulent wind generation with the integration of Gaussian-based wake deficit distribution.

A turbulent wind field generator by PEF on the website of https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/54491-3d-turbulent-wind-generation 
is used to produce the scenarios of wind inflow conditions without wake profiles,as TurbSim. The modified turbulent wind field generator with 
the integration of Gaussian-based wake deficit distribution is developed based on the 3D Turbulent Wind Generation.
